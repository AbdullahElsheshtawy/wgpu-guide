# Wgpu Api


# What is Wgpu
[wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) is a safe and portable graphics library for Rust based on the WebGPU API. It is suitable for general purpose graphics and compute on the GPU.
 Applications using wgpu run natively on Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, and OpenGL ES; and browsers via WebAssembly on WebGPU and WebGL2.


# Web Support
Although Wgpu Supports the web. This tutorial will not cover compile to the WASM mainly because:

- I do not have any experience in this domain so I cannot provide accurate information.
- I do not like the web

You are welcome to argue with me about it on an issue or submit a PR adding support to the web. But for now the web is not supported.
