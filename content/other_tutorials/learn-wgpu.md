# Learn Wgpu

[Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) is an extremely high quality tutorial on the basics of wgpu made by [Ben Hansen](https://github.com/sotrh). It goes through:
  - Web Support
  - Model Loading
  - Lighting

It also has challenges at the end of each part . I recommend going through this guide atleast once no matter your experience level.
